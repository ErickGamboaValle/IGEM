                        <p>Jalisco is the main berry exporter in Mexico. In 2015, the state produced $907,56 MDD,
                            representing 69.43% of the national total in this sector; even more important, at least
                            20,000 jobs depend on its production (INEGI, 2016). Also, these fruits provide nutritional
                            value,
                            contain a great diversity of antioxidants and polyphenols that can help improve people‚Äôs
                            health (Lashmanova, ùìÆùìΩ ùì™ùìµ 2012).

                            It's production, marketing and export has become more complicated thanks to the recurrence
                            of
                            fungal endophyte pests. These severe pests affect the quality and quantity of fruits that
                            can be produced, cause 16% of the economic losses worldwide in different crops (Fontana,
                            ùìÆùìΩ ùì™ùìµ 2021) and
                            may even trigger severe social consequences (Haverkort, ùìÆùìΩ ùì™ùìµ 2008).

                            According to El Informador, the crop of berries occupies the third place in the export of
                            agricultural products from Mexico, after beer and avocado. In 2019 it's estimated that
                            Mexico possessed more than 44,000 hectares of berries in the
                            western states of the country, however, the cultivation of these presents‚Äô challenges such
                            as safety, nutrition and irrigation needs, pest management and diseases. In addition, the
                            State Agenda for the Development of Jalisco, this state is in favor of one of the most
                            favorable ecosystems for the cultivation of blackberries and berries, is intended to promote
                            technologies for the exploitation of this product.

                        <p>Before we started developing our project, we needed to know and be able to empathize with the
                            people who would be impacted by our project. We started this process by organizing three
                            different interactions with our stakeholders through face-to-face talks and video calls to
                            learn about what they were doing in the field, the problems they were facing, the tools and
                            strategies they had to face them, and more.

                            and one of the reasons why crops are lost and/or are not enough in quantity and quality.

                            and inquire into the aspects that they considered important to determine whether we should
                            continue or discard this problem.

                            Evidence from interviews

                            The interviews yielded the following results:

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Cultivation area (municipality) We can observe that the berry cultivation area is in the
                            lower central part of the state of Jalisco, in the municipalities surrounding Lake Chapala
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Crop type

                            Most interviewees are engaged in producing blueberries, in addition, many farmers have
                            various types of crops.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Experience managing the crop

                            The experience of the producers was varied, many of them being agricultural engineers or
                            having the advice of some. The average experience of interviewees managing the crop is 3
                            years.
                        </p>
                        <p>3. What do you think are the three problems that currently affect your berry production the
                            most?

                            The most mentioned problems were pests, followed by water scarcity and pollution and third
                            other situations such as labor, supply and demand of the product among other details
                            concerning the marketing of the product.
                        </p>
                        <p>Among the most common pests they mentioned were TRIPS, red spider, rust; red spider turns out
                            to be the most ruthless, but rust and TRIPS are more common throughout the year.

                            There are two problems with water: contaminated water and scarcity.

                            In general, pests are more common, and even though some eventually wipe out entire crops,
                            farmers are more concerned about water-related problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>4. What factors have you found that cause or affect the problems you mentioned?

                            We can see that 14 of 17 producers determined that climate and temperatures cause or affect
                            the problems mentioned above. Followed by 11 votes to water availability and/or quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>5. What part of the production process is most affected by these problems?

                            The results were as follows: Pre-harvest 24% / Harvest 52% / Post-harvest 10% / Export 14% /
                            Other: 0%

                            Pre-harvest and harvest are the most affected stages. Being a chain, all stages of the
                            process are related.
                        </p>
                        <p>6. When was the last time you presented these problems in your berry crops?

                            In most cases the problems are experienced day by day, being some more intense such as lack
                            of water or seasonal pests.
                        </p>
                        <p>7. How are you trying to solve these problems?

                            Biocontrol and monitoring and pesticides and silicates were the most used responses by berry
                            producers.

                        <p>8. Would you be interested in using a biotech product to solve any of these problems?

                            In a general way everyone mentioned that they would be very interested in using some
                            alternative, even some gave us ideas of direction or offered us their fields to make tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>9. What would you need to give a biotech product a chance?

                            In general, what they seek is to make the current processes efficient without causing damage
                            to the lands and plants.
                            It is also important for them that the products do not leave residues and allow their crops
                            to remain organic, as it is a requirement for many marketers.
                            Having an economic benefit is also one of the needs that producers pointed out.
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Additional comments

                            The plastic used for crops has been concentrated as a contaminating residue of the area.
                            Many problems vary according to the size of the company. It is important to take into
                            account those we want to help; Big companies already have many standardized processes, but
                            small farmers do not have the investment or technology to cover these problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many workers are mothers with children; since the regulations against child labour became
                            stricter, they cannot take their children to the land and have nowhere to leave them.

                            There is an intense fight between avocados and berries Many of the soils are already badly
                            damaged, sometimes making it impossible to plant them, having to manage crops by pots or
                            hydroponics.

                            Given the high costs of land some have tried to reduce spaces by square meter costs,
                            affecting productivity and soils.
                            Conclusi√≥n

                            It was probed:

                            "The Botrytis cinerea plague is one of the main problems of farmers in the state of Jalisco
                            and one of the reasons why their crops are lost and/or are not enough in quantity and
                            quality".

                            It was correct, so the experiment is taken as successful.

                            The main problems of berry agriculture in Mexico on June 21, 2021, are:

                            1. Scarcity and/or pollution
                            2. Pests: Insects and fungi
                            3. Climate: Sudden temperature changes that enhance the main problems.

                            Harvest and post-harvest are the stages most affected by the main problems (water, pests,
                            climate) attacking every year.

                            100% of respondents are highly interested in accepting a biotechnology product that can
                            solve their problems. What these producers are looking for in these products are:

                            ‚Ä¢ Economic benefit (cost / benefit)

                        <p>Two visits were made to berry producing ranches asking the engineers and producers to show us
                            the production systems, their main problems day by day and how they try to solve them.

                            How are they produced? What is the production system?

                            In the initial stages of the crops the main thing to weed, later, after a while the "mother"
                            plant is removed to allow the growth of new shoots and seedlings, to eliminate a process
                            known as dominance. Weekly pest controls are done, usually the seedlings that are provided
                            come with pests and this is why fumigations are performed very often (1-2 times per week),
                            mainly to treat fungi such as rust, weeding are performed monthly. Also, one of the most
                            important processes to monitor is the irrigation system for proper water management. The
                            prevention of diseases is sought more with these fumigations because it is impractical to
                            wait for the plague to be largely inoculated. Other prevention methods are the use of
                            biorepellents (aromatic plants such as garlic, mimosa, cinnamon), or use of entomopathogenic
                            fungi (Beuveria bassiana, Trichoderma harzianum, etc). From planting to fruiting are 5
                            months or so.

                            The method that some cranberry producers have in this region, and case that has occurred
                            nationally, to manage this crop in pots of 40L with specialized substrates such as coconut
                            fiber and Vermiculite, in which the plant is established and managed for harvest. This
                            method has many advantages, taking as its main the water management and nutrition of the
                            plant, but do not forget that the root system of a plant is the most delicate part and by
                            which many diseases have their gateway, having control over this environment reduces the
                            chances of a disease.

                            You can really be harvesting all year for the handling we gave, but above all you have to
                            rely on the sales windows. For example, very good times to harvest is this, which is summer,
                            as of June-August (there is very good price on raspberry) and also from late January to May.
                            That is in fact, this year, almost mid-February until now there was a good price, very
                            stable.

                            How is it determined whether some fruit is export quality or not?

                            What is most careful is the size of the fruit and do not miss the "Bloom" (wax present in
                            the arandanos), since this gives a higher quality value to the fruit so the care of this
                            factor is indispensable, since it is very easy to affect the Bloom of the fruits, either
                            with poor management by fish farmers, or with the use of agrochemicals of an oily nature.

                            What are the main environmental problems?

                            According to the same producers, the greatest loss of crops occurs in the pre-harvest and
                            harvest.

                            The most mentioned problems were plagues, followed by water scarcity and pollution, and
                            third by other situations such as labour.

                            There are two problems with water: contaminated water and scarcity.

                            Also, many of the soils are already heavily damaged, sometimes making it impossible to plant
                            them, having to manage crops by pots or hydroponics.

                            Main diseases:
                            ‚Ä¢ Fosarium oxysporum: Fungus present in the soil that mainly affects the root of crops.
                            ‚Ä¢ Cladosporium cladosporioides: new disease in berries increasingly frequent in the states
                            of Michoac√°n and Jalisco.
                            ‚Ä¢ Red spider ("mites"): Plants are one of the most important biotic components of these
                            organisms, the main affectations are parasitism, predation and commensalism
                            ‚Ä¢ Drosophila Suzuki: Present in Mexico since 2011 and in all berry crops in the world


                            How much is lost (money or product) for each of these problems?

                            Its production, marketing and export has become more complicated thanks to the recurrence of
                            fungal endophyte pests. These severe pests affect the quality and quantity of fruits that
                            can be produced, causing 16% of the economic losses worldwide in different crops.

                            How are producers currently solving these problems?

                            Unique varieties have characteristics that make them resistant to certain diseases or pests.

                            Different biocontrol methods such as T. harzianum or B. subtilis for fungi and insects. Root
                            before planting. Glue traps. Cultures in pots with substrates.

                            Important aspects to keep in mind:

                            It is also important for them that the products do not leave residues and allow their crops
                            to remain organic, since it is a requirement for many marketers. Having an economic benefit
                            is also one of the needs that producers pointed out. Comply with the laws, certifications
                            and regulations concerning berry crops.

                            Follow the rules to export is necessary to make more profits, cannot leave residue, high
                            effectiveness (> 80%) at low cost, low or no toxicity.

                            Care should be taken that the products do not alter the ecosystem, since the most important
                            process of plants is pollination, action done mostly by pollinating insects such as bees,
                            butterflies and beetles, which may also affect the repellent and decrease the quality, size,
                            weight and fruit production in the plant. It is also important to take into account the pH,
                            EC and drainage values provided by the substrate, in order not to cause stress to the plant.
