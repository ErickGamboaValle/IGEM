            <p>Jalisco is the main berry exporter in Mexico. In 2015, the state produced $907,56 MDD,
              representing 69.43% of the national total in this sector; even more important, at least
              20,000 jobs depend on its production (INEGI, 2016). Also, these fruits provide nutritional
              value,
              contain a great diversity of antioxidants and polyphenols that can help improve people’s
              health (Lashmanova, 𝓮𝓽 𝓪𝓵 2012).
            </p>
            <p>
              It's production, marketing and export has become more complicated thanks to the recurrence
              of
              fungal endophyte pests. These severe pests affect the quality and quantity of fruits that
              can be produced, cause 16% of the economic losses worldwide in different crops (Fontana,
              𝓮𝓽 𝓪𝓵 2021) and
              may even trigger severe social consequences (Haverkort, 𝓮𝓽 𝓪𝓵 2008).
            </p>
            <p>
              According to El Informador, the crop of berries occupies the third place in the export of
              agricultural products from Mexico, after beer and avocado. In 2019 it's estimated that
              Mexico possessed more than 44,000 hectares of berries in the
              western states of the country, however, the cultivation of these presents’ challenges such
              as safety, nutrition and irrigation needs, pest management and diseases. In addition, the
              State Agenda for the Development of Jalisco, this state is in favor of one of the most
              favorable ecosystems for the cultivation of blackberries and berries, is intended to promote
              technologies for the exploitation of this product.
            </p>

            <p>Before we started developing our project, we needed to know and be able to empathize with the
              people who would be impacted by our project. We started this process by organizing three
              different interactions with our stakeholders through face-to-face talks and video calls to
              learn about what they were doing in the field, the problems they were facing, the tools and
              strategies they had to face them, and more.

            <p>
              In 2019 it is estimated that Mexico possessed more than 44,000 hectares. The berry growing
              area is located in the lower central part of the state of Jalisco, in the municipalities
              surrounding Lake Chapala. As well as municipalities such as: Tala, Zacoalco, Arandas,

            <h2 style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 25px;">INTERVEW</h2>
            <p>Seventeen interviews were conducted with agricultural engineers, producers and exporters in
              mixed modalities: face to face, videoconferences, telephone calls, audio notes. The purpose
              of the interviews was to find out whether:

              The Botrytis cinerea plague is one of the main problems of farmers in the state of Jalisco
              and one of the reasons why crops are lost and/or are not enough in quantity and quality.

              and inquire into the aspects that they considered important to determine whether we should
              continue or discard this problem.

              Evidence from interviews

              The interviews yielded the following results:

            </p>
            <p>1. Cultivation area (municipality) We can observe that the berry cultivation area is in the
              lower central part of the state of Jalisco, in the municipalities surrounding Lake Chapala
            </p>
            <img src="images/Human_practices/17- cultivation.png" alt="">
            <p>2. Crop type

              Most interviewees are engaged in producing blueberries, in addition, many farmers have
              various types of crops.
            </p>

            <img src="images/Human_practices/16. Crop type.PNG" alt="">
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">3. Experience managing the crop

              The experience of the producers was varied, many of them being agricultural engineers or
              having the advice of some. The average experience of interviewees managing the crop is 3
              years.
            </p>
            <p>4. What do you think are the three problems that currently affect your berry production the
              most?

              The most mentioned problems were pests, followed by water scarcity and pollution and third
              other situations such as labor, supply and demand of the product among other details
              concerning the marketing of the product.
            </p>

            <img src="images/Human_practices/17._Q6_Pareto currently problems.PNG" alt="">
            <p>Among the most common pests they mentioned were TRIPS, red spider, rust; red spider turns out
              to be the most ruthless, but rust and TRIPS are more common throughout the year.

              There are two problems with water: contaminated water and scarcity.

              In general, pests are more common, and even though some eventually wipe out entire crops,
              farmers are more concerned about water-related problems.
            </p>
            <p>5. What factors have you found that cause or affect the problems you mentioned?

              We can see that 14 of 17 producers determined that climate and temperatures cause or affect
              the problems mentioned above. Followed by 11 votes to water availability and/or quality.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">6. What part of the production process is most affected by these problems?

              The results were as follows: Pre-harvest 24% / Harvest 52% / Post-harvest 10% / Export 14% /
              Other: 0%

              Pre-harvest and harvest are the most affected stages. Being a chain, all stages of the
              process are related.

            <p style="margin-top: 35px;">7. When was the last time you presented these problems in your berry crops?

              In most cases the problems are experienced day by day, being some more intense such as lack
              of water or seasonal pests.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">8. How are you trying to solve these problems?

              Biocontrol and monitoring and pesticides and silicates were the most used responses by berry
              producers.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 75px;">In other solutions such as: </p>
            <li>
              • Coconut substrate pot bags for cranberry.
            </li>
            <li>Animals or insects beneficial to the environment; add plants to the sides of crops to
              distract pests.</li>
            <li>Pest control week by week, not letting the pest get big. Plastic glue trap, oils, physical
              controls like meshes.</li>
            <li>Manpower: Options to hire foreign people 1-2 hours on the way</li>
            <li>Water: More supply, more wells, but we don’t always get permission for the land. Water
              catchments or deeper wells,</li>
            <li>Harvest in a cool or shady place as the fruit is highly perishable, harvest when the
              temperature is lower and with shade.</li>




            <p style="margin-top: 55px; margin-bottom: 55px;">9. Would you be interested in using a biotech product to
              solve any of these problems?

              In a general way everyone mentioned that they would be very interested in using some
              alternative, even some gave us ideas of direction or offered us their fields to make tests.
            </p>
            <p>10. What would you need to give a biotech product a chance?

              In general, what they seek is to make the current processes efficient without causing damage
              to the lands and plants.
              It is also important for them that the products do not leave residues and allow their crops
              to remain organic, as it is a requirement for many marketers.
              Having an economic benefit is also one of the needs that producers pointed out.
            </p>

            <p>
              The plastic used for crops has been concentrated as a contaminating residue of the area.
              Many problems vary according to the size of the company. It is important to take into
              account those we want to help; Big companies already have many standardized processes, but
              small farmers do not have the investment or technology to cover these problems.
            </p>
            <p>Many workers are mothers with children; since the regulations against child labour became
              stricter, they cannot take their children to the land and have nowhere to leave them.

              There is an intense fight between avocados and berries Many of the soils are already badly
              damaged, sometimes making it impossible to plant them, having to manage crops by pots or
              hydroponics.</p>

            <p> Given the high costs of land some have tried to reduce spaces by square meter costs,
              affecting productivity and soils.</p>
            <p>In Conclusión It was proved that:</p>

            <p>
              "The Botrytis cinerea plague is one of the main problems of farmers in the state of Jalisco
              and one of the reasons why their crops are lost and/or are not enough in quantity and
              quality".</p>

            <p>It was correct, so the experiment is taken as successful.</p>

            <p>The main problems of berry agriculture in Mexico on June 21, 2021, are:</p>

            <li>1. Scarcity and/or pollution</li>
            <li> 2. Pests: Insects and fungi</li>
            <li> 3. Climate: Sudden temperature changes that enhance the main problems.</li>

            <p style="margin-top: 35px;">
              Harvest and post-harvest are the stages most affected by the main problems (water, pests,
              climate) attacking every year.

              100% of respondents are highly interested in accepting a biotechnology product that can
              solve their problems. What these producers are looking for in these products are:
            </p>

            <li>Economic benefit (cost / benefit)</li>
            <li>Functionality testing</li>
            <li>Safety</li>

              How are they produced? What is the production system?</h4>
            <p>
              In the initial stages of the crops the main thing to weed, later, after a while the "mother"
              plant is removed to allow the growth of new shoots and seedlings, to eliminate a process
              known as dominance. Weekly pest controls are done, usually the seedlings that are provided
              come with pests and this is why fumigations are performed very often (1-2 times per week),
              mainly to treat fungi such as rust, weeding are performed monthly. Also, one of the most
              important processes to monitor is the irrigation system for proper water management. The
              prevention of diseases is sought more with these fumigations because it is impractical to
              wait for the plague to be largely inoculated. Other prevention methods are the use of
              biorepellents (aromatic plants such as garlic, mimosa, cinnamon), or use of entomopathogenic
              fungi (Beuveria bassiana, Trichoderma harzianum, etc). From planting to fruiting are 5
              months or so.</p>

            <p>
              The method that some cranberry producers have in this region, and case that has occurred
              nationally, to manage this crop in pots of 40L with specialized substrates such as coconut
              fiber and Vermiculite, in which the plant is established and managed for harvest. This
              method has many advantages, taking as its main the water management and nutrition of the
              plant, but do not forget that the root system of a plant is the most delicate part and by
              which many diseases have their gateway, having control over this environment reduces the
              chances of a disease.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can really be harvesting all year for the handling we gave, but above all you have to
              rely on the sales windows. For example, very good times to harvest is this, which is summer,
              as of June-August (there is very good price on raspberry) and also from late January to May.
              That is in fact, this year, almost mid-February until now there was a good price, very
              stable.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;  text-align: left;">
              How is it determined whether some fruit is export quality or not?
            </h4>
            <p>
              What is most careful is the size of the fruit and do not miss the "Bloom" (wax present in
              the arandanos), since this gives a higher quality value to the fruit so the care of this
              factor is indispensable, since it is very easy to affect the Bloom of the fruits, either
              with poor management by fish farmers, or with the use of agrochemicals of an oily nature.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;  text-align: left;">
              What are the main environmental problems?
            </h4>

            <p>
              According to the same producers, the greatest loss of crops occurs in the pre-harvest and
              harvest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most mentioned problems were plagues, followed by water scarcity and pollution, and
              third by other situations such as labour.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are two problems with water: contaminated water and scarcity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, many of the soils are already heavily damaged, sometimes making it impossible to plant
              them, having to manage crops by pots or hydroponics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Main diseases:
            </p>

            <li>
              Fusarium oxysporum: Fungus present in the soil that mainly affects the root of crops.</li>
            <li>
              Cladosporium cladosporioides: new disease in berries increasingly frequent in the states
              of Michoacán and Jalisco.</li>
            <li>
              Red spider ("mites"): Plants are one of the most important biotic components of these
              organisms, the main affectations are parasitism, predation and commensalism</li>
            <li>
              Drosophila Suzuki: Present in Mexico since 2011 and in all berry crops in the world
            </li>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;  text-align: left;">
              How much is lost (money or product) for each of these problems?
            </h4>
            <p>

              Its production, marketing and export has become more complicated thanks to the recurrence of
              fungal endophyte pests. These severe pests affect the quality and quantity of fruits that
              can be produced, causing 16% of the economic losses worldwide in different crops.
            </p>

            <p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;  text-align: left;"> How are producers currently solving these problems?</h4>
            <p>
              Unique varieties have characteristics that make them resistant to certain diseases or pests.
            </p>

            <p>
              Different biocontrol methods such as T. harzianum or B. subtilis for fungi and insects. Root
              before planting. Glue traps. Cultures in pots with substrates.
            </p>


            <h4 style=" margin-bottom: 35px;  text-align: left;"> Important aspects to keep in mind:</h4>
            <p>
              It is also important for them that the products do not leave residues and allow their crops
              to remain organic, since it is a requirement for many marketers. Having an economic benefit
              is also one of the needs that producers pointed out. Comply with the laws, certifications
              and regulations concerning berry crops.
            </p>

            <p>
              Follow the rules to export is necessary to make more profits, cannot leave residue, high
              effectiveness (> 80%) at low cost, low or no toxicity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Care should be taken that the products do not alter the ecosystem, since the most important
              process of plants is pollination, action done mostly by pollinating insects such as bees,
              butterflies and beetles, which may also affect the repellent and decrease the quality, size,
              weight and fruit production in the plant. It is also important to take into account the pH,
              EC and drainage values provided by the substrate, in order not to cause stress to the plant.
