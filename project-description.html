              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 55px;">What is BerryVax</h2>
              <div style="margin-top: 35px;">
                <img id="img-align" src="images/project/01 pd.png" alt="" height="330px" style="margin-right: 25px;">
                <p>At iGEM ITESO, we created BerryVax as an integrated biotechnological solution for fungal pests and
                  water scarcity in berry fields. This is possible by the enhancement of Bacillus subtilis, a
                  world-spread
                  bacteria present in the soil, to make it overproduce surfactin, which is a biosurfactant (Coutte et
                  al.,
                  2015). This substance permits B. subtilis to act as a pythovaccine, which means it works as a vaccine
                  for plants, since it allows their defense system to stay alert, avoiding pathogens to enter it, while
                  also improving surface wettability and fruit quality (Salehi et al., 2010; Coutte et al., 2015).
                  Adding
                  to this, when BerryVax is exposed to fusaric acid, a compound made by fungi, it will start producing
                  chitinase, a compound that degrades glucans, chitin and fatty acids present in pathogenic fungi that
                  attack berry plants (Swain, 2008; Sandoval-Chávez et al., 2015). This is done by degrading via the
                  production of chitinase. This way, BerryVax, will have two different action modes: the preventive and
                  the corrective one. </p>

              <h2>Why is BerryVax? </h2>
              <h3 style="text-align: left;">Defining our topic </h3>
              <p>Synthetic biology can be applied to uncountable scenarios, which is why we decided to have an open
                perspective about the issue we chose to work on. For this reason, each one of the team members worked on
                a researching about a local or global issue that they were interested in, like teen pregnancies, berry
                pests, depression, diabetes, and electronic waste. Each team member developed an empathy map, as well as
                an archetype for the people that would need the proposed solution.
                After presenting all the possible topics within the team, we voted for our favourites, and the top five
                were turned into investigation lines. After doing our research on each one of them, we reached out to
                stakeholders, to help us validate if our concept of the situation was really a problem or not. Later, we
                presented our investigation results to different professors, as well as to Ana Ruth Quintero, former
                iGEM ITESO team member, and iGEM LATAM Ambassador. Thanks to their feedback, we decided where we could
                make a greater impact, which lead us to choose treating pests in berry fields.

              <h3>Getting involved </h3>
              <p>Our state, Jalisco, is one of the main berry producers and exporters of the country. According to
                ANEBERRIES’s general director, Juan José Flores García (personal communication, May 23rd, 2022), there’s
                more than 34,000 hectares of berry fields just in Jalisco, which currently give employment to more than
                500,000 people. And, according to Lagunes-Fortiz et al., (2020), from 2003 to 2016, there has been a
                21.8% increase in the Mexican berries production, which indicates that this field will continue to grow.
                However, as we learned more about the berry production context here in Jalisco by talking with different
                stakeholders, we discovered that pests were only a fraction of their problems, which is why we decided
                to amplify our solution’s reach by targeting both water scarcity and pests.
                Thanks to the multiple interactions we had with our stakeholders, we were able to design BerryVax, a
                solution that will satisfy their main needs: keeping their crops healthy, organic, and productive. You
                can learn more about our Human Practices process by clicking here

              <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">How we developed BerryVax</h3>
              <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                <img id="img-align" src="images/project/05 pd.png" alt="" height="160px" style="margin-right: 25px;">
                <p>We found that fungal pests were getting each time more harmful for berry producers, since a lot of
                  them, like pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum, infect the plants at its roots, making its early detection
                  very hard. This fungus is considered a hemibiotroph. First, it uses the plant as a host to take
                  advantage of its healthy tissues and later, it starts degrading its immune system and tissues by
                  producing toxins and virulence factors to use the plant’s nutrients (Lyons et al., 2015). </p>
              </div>

              <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                <img id="img-align" src="images/project/06 pd.png" alt="" height="160px" style="margin-right: 25px;">
                <p>Even though in some of the crops we visited the plants were regularly checked for pathogens, which
                  prevented the infection from being spread across the field, it was still very difficult to treat the
                  sicknesses without using traditional methods, like agrochemicals, which can not only harm the
                  ecosystem and the living beings in it, but can also affect the chances of producers to sell their
                  fruits at a good price due to the growing demand for organic berries. </p>
              </div>

              <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
                <img id="img-align" src="images/project/07 pd.png" alt="" height="160px" style="margin-right: 25px;">
                <p>Taking this into account, we decided to focus on treating fungal pests in berries through Synthetic
                  Biology and, after a lot of research, it was found that a way to do it was via the overproduction of
                  surfactin, a biosurfactant capable of providing protection to the plant in both pre- and post-harvest
                  conditions (Valenzuela et al., 2020), which makes it even more useful for producers, since they had
                  told us there were losses in both of these stages.
                  Furthermore, when looking for microorganisms who produced this compound, we found our chassis,
                  Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium that can be found in the soil. Adding to this, B. subtilis also
                  promotes plant growth, enhances biotic stress tolerance, and improves surface wettability
                  (Radhakrishan et al., 2017; Salehi et al., 2010).
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, since BerryVax would need to be released into the environment to be used as a biocontrol
                  method, a biocontainment mechanism was needed. Therefore, a suicide switch based on team iGEM LMU
                  Munich (2012) one was included. To know more about our genetic circuit’s development, you can click
