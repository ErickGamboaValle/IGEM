                        <div>
                            <p>
                                iGEM has become a great source of information and resources thanks to the participation
                                of thousands of students from all around the world. However, each team and project have
                                a very high level of complexity, which is why useful contributions keep appearing each
                                year. In our case, what we found more challenging about navigating through the
                                competition was knowing how to start, manage a team, plan a project, and keep track of
                                our progress. For this reason, we created a guide designed to help future iGEMers build
                                their team, protect their projects, and make the most out of their resources.
                            </p>
                            <h3>How to build an iGEM team</h3>
                            <p>
                                An iGEM project requires time and dedication, to get out of your comfort zone and to
                                face new situations like the ones you would face when you start a new job. We know that
                                it is a difficult process, trying to build a team having little to none experience. This
                                guide pretends to give a series of steps and key points to consider when you create a
                                team and develop a project. It was designed with the knowledge obtained in the length of
                                two years of work by trial and error and gathers all our key lessons. Our goal is that,
                                if you want to start and iGEM team or to adjust your dynamics and you do not know how,
                                you can use this document to go step by step. This guide expands in the themes of
                                running a team in the daily bases, beyond the exposed in the iGEM rules and resources.
                                We recommend reading the rules previously to have a general context of the subjects we
                                abord so you can complement with the all the other requirements requested by iGEM HQ
                                that are not mentioned in this reference (specifically around the collaborations with
                                other teams). All that is exposed in the present document are recommendations made by
                                the iGEM ITESO team.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Recruitment</h3>
                            <h4>By ability, by areas, features to identify</h4>
                            <p>
                                The most important part in forming a team is gathering the right people to raise the
                                work that the project is going to imply. You might have the initiative to create a team,
                                but that you don’t know the amount of people necessary to accomplish all the work you
                                need. That’s why we recommend a recruitment process open to the general public, to give
                                the opportunity to the whole community to be a part of it and not just your direct
                                acquaintances. When you start an iGEM team, the focus in finding a team member is not
                                someone who can do everything, but someone who has disposition and commitment to the
                                project. The general goal is to develop a project with synthetic biology that looks over
                                the social good. The specific goals will be determined after you have a stablished team.
                                We suggest this in order to really integrate, even if some people have the initiative to
                                create the team, the job would be by and for everyone. You search to create a united and
                                solid team, that does not replicate the harmful conducts that we can see in the current
                                world. To create a better world starts from the team’s dynamic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before you begin, you need to consider that iGEM has a list of requirements that you
                                need to comply to get a medal: a wiki (webpage), a project promotion video, human
                                practices, lab work, collaborations, implementation, engineering success, biosafety
                                requirements and other types of forms related to the team’s progress (like the team
                                roster).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additional to this you must select three areas to develop excellency in them (in order
                                to get a gold medal). IGEM offers options such as a wider human development, the
                                improvement of a genetic existing part, the project modeling, the proof of concept,
                                camaraderie, education and communication among others. For more information on the
                                subject
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important to know this before starting to look for people for your team. Even when
                                it is a project centered around synthetic biology members of many areas of knowledge can
                                participate. To have a multidisciplinary team is a key decision that would have a direct
                                impact on how much you would accomplish inside the project and the quality of the
                                deliverables. We suggest searching for members in these areas:

                                Audiovisual arts: creation of audiovisual quality content. For example, you would
                                create a better content for the presentation video or to make diverse contributions to

                            </h3>

                            <p>A good PI is one of the most important parts of team building. You need to look for
                                someone who is as committed to the team as any other team member. There will be times
                                where keep up motivation will be difficult, or where there will be conflicts that are
                                beyond your capabilities. Therefore, you should have an PI that acts as an authority
                                figure within the team. Trust is key to give it a power of this level within the team.
                                In the student members of the team the general decision of issues related to the
                                development of the project must be maintained. PI acts in situations such as: </p>
                            <li>
                                Internal conflict between team members.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Acting where the situation exceeds the knowledge of members. For example, be evident
                                if the project is in danger in a certain way, warn to the fact that some outsider is
                                acting badly with the team (trying to take advantage of the students), areas of
                                opportunity where the team does not know how to respond.
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                The overall objective is a PI from which one can learn beyond synthetic biology, like
                                social skills, networking, time management, about the workplace, etc. A hand of trust
                                where you don't know how to act that comes from a person equally passionate about the
                                project. In our experience, a PI that contributed to our meetings and dialogues resulted
                                in better organization and maintained as a formal project. As a team, it´s also
                                important to look for how to remunerate a professional who contributes so much to the
                                team because his starting point is different from that of a student. One way to do this
                                is to see if your college can pay for extra hours spent working with you.

                                For instructors, select people who have the time and availability to evaluate their work
                                closely. Evaluate in which areas you have less knowledge or require more training and
                                look for people who can cover the roles based on that. We recommend searching within
                                your university to facilitate the work and can also support with direct topics with the
                                university. Instructors and PI also serve to support and give formality to the project,
                                take it into account when selecting them, as well as issues with whom they can be
                                linked, or what resources they can offer to the project.

                            <h3>3. Problematic identification</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to select the problematic, we suggest using a different approach. To each team
                                member it would be assigned as a first task to investigate an existing problem in their
                                city in which they think synthetic biology could have a significant impact. Each person
                                will investigate and perform a short presentation of the problem (around 3 minutes), and
                                how it impacts their community. After this, the most interesting affairs for the team
                                would be voted upon to select 3 or 4 problems. Once selected, small work teams would be
                                built to perform more detailed research of each problem and to propose a preliminary way
                                to solve them or a first creative solution in order to see a possible mean to do it.
                                This would not necessarily be the final one, it behaves as a first approximation that
                                would help identify the ways you can apply synthetic biology in their area of interest.
                                This process allows to select relevant issues for all the team, where all are interested
                                in working.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Starting with a well justified subject to work on, allows us to have more creative
                                liberty when it came to find a solution. It was also important to give the community a
                                significant update that responded to the current needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A recommendation is to establish previous parameters to the creative sessions. These
                                parameters can be the stablished problematic, some limitations of the people that would
                                use the solution, or few points that as a team you agree not to approach. These
                                boundaries allow to explore more creative routes or to find inspiration with an
                                objective in mind.

                            <h4>Build a selection committee</h4>

                            <p>
                                We recommend building a team of professionals or professors with experience in the areas
                                of the selected problematics. We search for experts that know about the issue from all
                                angles: social, economic, scientific, environmental, or any other that as a team you
                                consider important. Once gathered, summit a session in which you present them the ideas
                                that you have in which they can bring to the table their area of expertise about what to
                                and what not to do about the subject. This step allows to corroborate if the selected
                                topic is feasible to work with, not only from the scientific point of view.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, we were interested in working with bees, with the correlation between
                                depression and intestinal microbiota, with the pollution of an important body of water
                                in our state and with the berry's cultures. In the session with the selected committee
                                some perspectives were approached about to how we could conduct the investigation and
                                the implications in the theme of regulations. For example, talking about the
                                problematics of depression, it was mentioned that working and collecting human samples,
                                as well as the use of personal and clinical data was a delicate subject and that our
                                university had limitations about working with biological samples in the laboratory. When
                                we presented the idea of working with the body of water, we were said that in order to
                                be able to experiment we would need to replicate the lake’s conditions in a tank in our
                                university or in a research facility. Another of our proposals implied the genetic
                                modification of a fungi, in which we were told that from a technical point of view It
                                was complicated. Around agriculture, we were commented upon about the social and labor
                                difficulties faced by the field workers and that getting involved in that would require
                                care. These perspectives helped us rethink which was the way that as team we wanted to
                                take, being conscious of the social, normative and technical obstacles we would face. It
                                was also important to know what we could and couldn’t work inside our university.

                            <h4>Resource bank</h4>
                            <p>
                                From the beginning, we implemented a template called “resource bank”. This template is
                                an Excel document where each member recorded any resource they had at their disposal. It
                                started from spaces for team meetings, personal skills (singing, cooking, painting,
                                programming, laboratory skills, digital design, courses we had done in any area of
                                knowledge, etc.); if they had a car to move the team in activities, if they had a
                                business (regardless of the category). The purpose of this format is to make the most of
                                all the resources the team has. Once you know what the team have inside, it is easier to
                                know where you can move to get sponsorships, to organize events, if you want to organize
                                a giveaway you know what you could offer without a cost to the team. Knowing where you
                                stand, and the strength of the team facilitates the process of seeing a course for each
                                area of the project.

                                The contact directory has a similar function to the resource bank. This adds all the
                                relevant contacts that each team member has. These contacts may be relevant within
                                companies, with knowledge that the team does not have, potential donors or sponsors, or
                                that may offer services to the team, potential stakeholders, or people who may be
                                interested in the competition or in the team. In doing so, it´s important to note that
                                any contact may be relevant in the future. It is better to have more than limit the
                                possibilities of support from the beginning. The format includes the record of the
                                contact, phone number or email, and person of the team that has the link.

                            <p>
                                Since we had identified and selected the problem, we developed a directory of
                                stakeholders. A stakeholder is an interested person, belonging to an organization or
                                company, who may have participation in the given organization (in this case in your iGEM
                                team). This directory allows you to register people who might be or are already
                                interested. And by including an additional section on whether you have been contacted or
                                not, you can keep track of which contacts it is important to make more approaches and
                                establish a relationship, either to seek possible sponsorship or to include it in human
                                practices for project development.

                            <h3>6. Identification of strong areas as a team</h3>
                            <p>
                                To have a successful project, you need to identify strong and weak areas as a team, and
                                plan around that. We learned this after participating in the IGEM Design League, so we
                                recommend evaluating for a league before going to the Grand Jamboree. Design League
                                gives you the tools to gain fundamental theoretical knowledge and participating allows
                                you to see their overall dynamics as a team and what to adjust for best results. Above
                                all, being a 100% new team or where most members have not participated in the
                                competition before, having a trial period like this is basic to see the reality of where
                                there are standing and how to continue. It is also important to know how support other
                                IGEM teams and what to request support, in addition to scheduling advice, courses and
                                training form other parts with time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With Design League we learned that we needed extra work in synthetic biology and
                                mathematical modeling, as our knowledge was limited compared to the level needed. We
                                also saw that our audiovisual content and human practices had potential beyond what we
                                detected. Another way to do this is studying the work of previous years IGEM teams: see
                                what they did, how you can do it, and what else they can contribute. We recommend
                                talking both roads. After studying this, compare with the skills and resources available
                                and take this information to select criteria of excellence. With opportunity areas
                                applies the same idea. Detect where you have the least knowledge, see what other IGEM
                                teams do and how to get there, search available resources, ask for advice or
                                collaborations with other teams where relevant.

                            <h3>7. Project planning </h3>
                            <p>
                                A requisite for good project management is the planning of the activities to be carried.
                                We tried diverse ways, and the first planning process delayed us months, this method was
                                to establish a deliverable and break down the activities necessary to achieve this
                                report. The problem was that we broke down these activities into too small and specific
                                tasks from start to finish of the project, this did not consider that there would be
                                errors and did not allow to manage them. We recommend you use project management tools
                                and software, currently there are many pages and applications that offer this service,
                                we suggest you investigate them and choose the one that best suits your style of
                                organization and work. The second planning process that gave us better results is the
                                following:


                                1. Start of the Project: Define the goals you want to reach, consider the personal
                                achievement objectives of each team member (why did they join the team?), and rely on
                                the medal criteria established by IGEM to set objectives. This can be done by talking
                                the manual where each criterion is defined and how to achieve it (available on the IGEM
                                website), starting first with bronze, then silver, and then selecting 3 or more areas of
                                excellence for gold. Subsequently, align personal goals to fit within these criteria.
                                For this we leave you a Project Charter template for your team to define your project.
                                <a href="https://iteso01.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/IngenieraGentica/EVPXI6v6uhFAoSOSOCFkPCMBAmBXZBXb-5K7J_s1uNautA?e=nfFjbn"
                                    target="_blank">link</a>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                2. Project planning: Define the activity to be conducted in order to achieve each of
                                these objectives, it is a question of proposing specific projects that they should
                                develop. For example, if you selected excellence in Human Practices, what do you want to
                                do as a team to meet this criterion? For example, we selected excellence in education,
                                we wanted to develop a project around feminism or indigenous inclusion. Knowing that
                                this was what we wanted to achieve, we already had something to work towards.




                                From each of these subprojects it is important to define which objective is linked, the
                                members who will be developing the subproject, its deliverable or result and a tentative
                                date of completion.

                                3. Execution: This is when you use the equipment management tools, add all the
                                subprojects to these tools. We suggest at least one of the following:

                                <li>
                                    Grantt diagram
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Kanban board
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To-do list
                                </li>
                                <a href="https://iteso01.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/IngenieraGentica/EZbINAYT4cNNu1GDjvpJ-RMBeNI88XGh_rmV85ljfe9btw?e=T9e1dy"
                                    target="_blank"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Go step by step in weekly intervals, counting how much time is available to complete the
                                project and if this is enough to finish what you want to do. Schedule IGEM deliverable
                                dates and that to have ready for that day. With that information, act and above all do
                                not waste time, nor leave weeks without anything scheduled that contributes to the goal.
                                Build step by step each deliverable.

                                It´s important to have a follow-up meeting (we recommend you at least one per week, but
                                without falling into unnecessary meetings as they steal effective work time) where the
                                equipment management tools are reviewed, the progress of activities is exposed, the
                                activities that follow, if assistance is needed to complete an activity or some resource
                                (money, laboratory facilities, etc.) new activities are created to further develop the
                                sub-project, and ream decisions are made, Also, assign a responsible person per
                                follow-up board to take note of the development of the meeting and share ir at the end
                                of the meeting in case any member could not attend.

                            <h3>8. Team organization</h3>
                            For us, the focus of an iGEM team goes beyond creating a project that give to the common
                            wellbeing. To develop a project of this fashion contributes directly to the personal growth
                            of each of the members involved. It is important to consider that, being students (probably
                            inexperienced), they will be mistakes and multiple areas in which you will not know what to
                            do. The objective of each team member does not revolve around perfection, but around
                            personal growth. The proposed organization considers this aspect as a goal. Not only to
                            develop an effective solution, but to be better people and professionals once we end this
                            project. Because of this the management focus is multidisciplinary, inclusive and with equal
                            responsibilities for every team member.

                            </p>
                            <h4>Area division</h4>
                            <p>
                                An iGEM team needs to be multidisciplinary. To make sure that you have enough people in
                                your team, you should verify the areas that your project should cover. The mandatory
                                areas for the medal requirements are:
                                <li>
                                    Human practices
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Laboratories (wet lab and dry lab)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Wiki (programming)

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Biosafety
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Communication (production of audiovisual material)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Project implementation
                                </li>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additional to this, it is vital to have a project management area. People whose work
                                field are planning and organization of the project and its resources in general. In our
                                case, this area was driven by industrial engineering students. The success we perceived
                                by our team is directly related to the planning or management performed.
                                Another non mandatory section we developed was entrepreneurship. The business focus in
                                this area is linked to management and project implementation. Even if your goal as a
                                team does not include the entrepreneurial excellency, this area improves to the
                                viability evaluation of the project, helps create contacts and to showcase your team. We
                                widely recommend taking this perspective into account.

                            </p>
                            <h4>Organized by projects</h4>
                            <p>We worked for a year with the common management of an iGEM team. A team divided into
                                areas, with a leader by area and a core team that joins all the area leaders. However,
                                we noticed that this management style kept us apart and disconnected among us, adding to
                                the fact that many of the responsibilities fall on the leaders, making that some team
                                members loose motivation and disconnected from the objectives.
                                Our organization proposal is a management by projects. If there is a task, activity or
                                deliverable, each one of these would be a project. For example, when looking for
                                sponsorship this would be the area of work, to organize a reunion with a potential
                                sponsor is a project inside the work area and this project would have specific tasks
                                like preparing a presentation, make a memo, contact the sponsor or arrange the space in
                                which the meeting would take place. Each of these tasks is performed by a different
                                person, and the project leader would confirm that everything is done. The general goal
                                of this management model is that you can collaborate in any area that takes your
                                interest with specific tasks in any point of the project. This focus also has the
                                objective that the work does not fall into a few people in charge, boosting teamwork and
                                the personal evolution of each of the members.
                                For this organization model, a commitment that must be done as a team member is to be
                                aware and attentive to everything that is being developed, the active/past/future
                                projects and the objectives you have for the competition. Additionally, that when you
                                enter the team, you make a commitment to participate in projects that not only involve
                                one area. Those who wish to participate only in one area is a “collaborator”. A
                                collaborator could be any person interested in the project, but that wishes to
                                participate only in one of the projects of the big one. When you are a collaborator, you
                                do not need to comply with the obligations of the team members (explained later), but
                                you would get your full credit for the performed task. Establishing the collaborator
                                role allows to include more people in the project and make a stronger community.

                            <h4>Establishing team rules</h4>

                            <p>
                                Rules are fundamental to set the ground of what it is expected from each team member. To
                                start with, there are the iGEM foundation values and the rules established by them
                                (available in the iGEM website). The values they propose are integrity, good
                                sportsmanship, respect, honesty, celebration, cooperation, effort and excellence. Our
                                suggestion is to add the following:
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                Responsibility: fulfil your duties inside the project in time and form, besides to be
                                thoughtful and careful with the team when taking decisions, your individual actions
                                affect all the environment, and it is necessary to take it into account every time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Empathy: put yourselves in the shoes of the other both when creating a solution and
                                when you work with other people.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Proactivity: take initiative and make the remaining tasks without the need to be asked
                                to.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Commitment: have consciousness of what entering a project of this nature means. Make
                                an informed and responsible decision, know that your work or the lack of it would affect
                                the functioning and the general fulfillment of the team. Comply with the part you said
                                you will, without excuses.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Equity: know that we are a community, and nobody is more important than others
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Curiosity: question what it is presented to you, do not take the things as facts only
                                because someone said so. Question ideas until you reach the bottom and have a full
                                understanding of them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Social consciousness: to be aware of our privilege and how it can affect of benefit
                                our work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gender perspective: to know that we all have interior sexism and that it has an effect
                                in our way of seeing the world and making science. To take the necessary actions to
                                eliminate it and replace it with values and attitudes that come from equality.
                            </li>

                            <h4>Commitment letter</h4>
                            <p>
                                To establish an informed commitment between all the participant parties, you must
                                develop a commitment letter in which you explain all the settlements you agree when
                                working with the team. This letter should include a definition of the team roles, the
                                iGEM and team commitments, the values that rule the job, engagements with the
                                institutions where you will perform the project, warnings and sanctions, a
                                confidentiality and image use agreement, and a section about the intellectual property
                                if it is relevant to the objectives.
                                The part of the intellectual property is an important point that we consider since, in
                                the future we are interested in creating a business from the developed work. If in your
                                goals as a team is something you find attractive, you must define who, and why you own
                                the idea, and you must clarify to those members who are not, this situation before they
                                become a part of the team. For example, we develop the idea for BerryVax for iGEM Design
                                League. The general concept and the value idea was developed from January to December
                                2021. The executed work, performed after, was an adjustment to an already existing
                                concept and completing the other areas of the project. The members that entered the team
                                after this date have an intellectual property of their work, but they cannot use the
                                concept as theirs. Besides, in our penalty we included a section in which, if you are
                                removed or resign from the team you give up to your intellectual property. This last
                                part was decided as a team and works with our style of work, we recommend adjusting the
                                rules to your perspective and considerations, and even receive legal advice if it is
                                possible.
                                We propose the following roles inside the team:

                                Consent letters, notice of privacy
                                Usually employed in the health sector to inform the patient about their diagnosis,
                                treatment, risks and benefits, as well as possible alternatives. We design an informed
                                consent letter to release information about the involved people on the research and
                                validation of the solution proposal, such as commentaries, video and audio recordings,
                                photographs, etc. That would be used for the project development and possibly published
                                as part of the corresponding deliverables for the team Wiki, also that their personal
                                data would not be used with any aim different from the established in such letter.
                                It is specified that the participation process in the research is completely voluntary.

                                Information compilation
                                It is important to have a platform in which all the documents generated are compilated:
                                consent letters, commitment letters, signatures, etc. All these documents that bring
                                more or less to the project must be in the same platform. This allows to have the last
                                versions of a document always available and avoid losing information, also to have
                                access to the information worked by other team members and have an effective
                                organization of what we have and what we are missing. We recommend the MS Teams
                                platform, since it allows to create folders, tabs, meetings, have chatrooms, among
                                others that were key to our team management. Other cloud services might work as well.

                            <p>
                                At first it was decided to have a core team without appointing an official leader since
                                we wanted to have the same hierarchy all within the team. Over time we realized that in
                                this model we were losing guidance and there were still unnamed leaders acting without
                                parameters of common agreement. We established key points that were important to us as a
                                team:

                                • All members must have equal weight in decisions
                                • Same level of intellectual property and responsibility with the project
                                • No one should send anyone or decide the course of the project without prior agreement
                                among all team members

                                Key qualities were established that are sought in a team leader: determination,
                                assertive communication, character safety, affective time management, ability to
                                delegate tasks, in addition to the values established for a team member. For us, the
                                role a leader should have is:

                                • Be responsible for administrative procedures: payment of registration/IGEM fees,
                                direct resource management with the institution or university, request approval from the
                                institution when necessary
                                • Contact with management members of the institution or university where the project is
                                developed. Person, you approach if someone outside needs something from the team,
                                designated point of contact that you can channel to contact other team members if
                                needed.
                                • Always keep project goals in mind and make sure steps are being taken to meet each of
                                them
                                • Look out compliance with internal and IGEM HQ rules
                                • Maintains team unity
                                • If there is money, it ensures that it is managed responsibly and that all necessary
                                payments are made
                                • Resolve conflicts before scaling them to be addresses by the PI
                                • Support point for more tam members

                                It is important to stand out that being a team leader carries a big responsibility.
                                While it is not the job of the of the leader to fulfill all the tasks within the team or
                                the overall management of the team, it does involve more work meeting institutional
                                requirements and other issues that arise within a team. There are key issues of grand
                                delicacy that a leader deals with, in our case mainly around tax issues such as billing
                                or money management that can only be handled by the leader and cannot be delegated. In
                                addition, along the way many unexpected situations arise that add to the effort to
                                maintain consistency and motivation in the team. This represents an emotional weight for
                                the leader that must be considered before taking the position. While a leader has
                                qualities developed before, he also continues to grow and learn leadership like other
                                team members with their respective areas. Therefore, a PI that serves as a guide and
                                support is vital, as well as dividing leadership responsibility between two people who
                                complement each other.

                            <p>
                                We recommend that you join your team to your college from the beginning. Doing so can
                                help them access facilities, money, or other resources more easily. Also, you need to do
                                so before you start working to avoid breaking institutional rules. In some cases, they
                                approve the use of the institution´s name as a team name or grant permission to use the
                                establishment logo. In our case, even issues like our logo saying the name of the
                                institution needed approval from an internal committee. Just as when seeking
                                sponsorships, people in the institution must evaluate and approve it, and usually there
                                are rules already established. Check ahead of time to avoid delaying equipment
                                processes.

                            <h3>11. Funding </h3>
                            <p>What for some teams can be a month of savings, in a Latin American context and adjusted
                                to the salaries commonly received, are equivalent to 6 months or more pf challenging
                                work. This makes sponsorship vital to complete the project. To remove the shortest time
                                form project construction work, effective activities must be performed that take little
                                effort but give high income. For example, an activity to do to collect money can be a
                                conference or a course. However, the planning time is long and involves many additional
                                points (spaces, diploma management, design of the exposed material, advertising to the
                                activity, design, and sale of tickets, etc.). Activities such scuffles require less
                                planning and are reduced to the effort of ticket sales and tax management of the money
                                collected, plus they can have the same economic return (collecting the same amount of
                                money as with congress). The point is seen how to invest as little time as possible and
                                align it to your goals as a team so as not be distracted form the focus of the team that
                                should always be the project.


                                Another way to get money is through companies. Before you take this route, you should
                                know how you would manage the money. From how you would spend it, to what account it
                                would be deposited to and the tax aspects that this implies. Some universities allow
                                money into their account if it is an institutionalized and official team. Evaluate this
                                possibility with your university and the implications it has. You can also watch it with
                                other student groups that already manage money to see the possibilities you team has. To
                                start contacting companies we recommend the following process:
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                1. Find contacts. Either through the team’s resource bank or on platforms like LinkedIn.
                                An effective way is to look for companies that are close to or interested in your
                                project, as well as those that have an area of philanthropy that is interested in
                                supporting independent science. You can also search for companies that can donate
                                something in kind (laboratory equipment, flights, consultancies, something you can then
                                sell to collect money, etc.)
                                2. Establish communication. You can go from a presentation email saying that they are
                                interested in working with the company and looking for a possible sponsorship with them.
                                Another way is through LinkedIn, send direct messages to people you find indicating the
                                same point and wait for a response. Many will not answer, overestimate the number of
                                people planning to contact.
                                3. Work together with those interested in sponsoring the team. Prepare a presentation of
                                their work considering for the intellectual property of the team and not divulge vital
                                information of their development. This presentation should contain who you are, what you
                                are doing, how much money you need, and what you can offer in exchange for this money.
                                To know how much money you need, make a final budget of the best-case scenario in
                                financial matters. Considers costs of laboratory, research, human practices,
                                collaborations, transfer to do validation interviews, necessary advice, trip to the
                                Grand Jamboree, etc. Anything that costs the team and its members must be included in
                                the budget. In our experience, the total cost of the project was around $50,000.


                                To find out what you can offer in exchange for this money make a table of sponsorship
                                levels based on the resources you have at hand and your strong areas as a team. We knew
                                that our audiovisual content was excellent, so we offered this in return. Depending on
                                how much money is given to the team, are the benefits offered in return. Other benefits
                                you can offer in return (specifically in Mexico) is tax deductibility. Research
                                requirements well and whether you can do so through your university.
                                It is important to come to these meetings with an optimistic vision. Go for everything,
                                but if it is not within the possibilities of the company to give everything you request,
                                propose other modes of support. The idea is not to come out empty-handed from any
                                meeting. Even if it’s a small support, everything contributes.

                                4. After the meetings, follow up closely. Appoint a person to be in touch with this
                                sponsor and insist when you feel it is necessary. Getting a sponsorship needs
                                determination. Don’t give up until you get a resounding no from the company.
                                5. If they succeed in obtaining the appeal, a letter shall be drawn up as a sponsorship
                                agreement. It is a sensitive issue and is written like a contract, so they can seek
                                legal advice if necessary. Carefully break down what will be given in exchange for
                                sponsorship and delivery dates. Avoid over-committing or giving room for ambiguities.
                                This contract is protection for both the sponsor and the team.

                            <h3>12. Points to consider in a Latin American team</h3>
                            <p>
                                The situation of science in Latin America or in a developing country is very different
                                to the one faced by teams in countries with a better political and scientific
                                development. What it is more important to consider is that besides the work that a
                                project entails in all its areas, you face conflicts that imply additional work. These
                                additional tasks add time to the total need by the project, making that you need more
                                than the double or triple amount of time to make it. The social context of your team
                                affects directly to how it is performed, and the reality is that we are not in equal
                                footing with other countries. Each one of the additional tasks that must be done, or
                                even the extra effort for each member to complete them subtracts time that otherwise
                                would be used to complete the project. This is not a reason not to participate, but it
                                is necessary to take it into account when making the planning and recruitment, since you
                                would need more time a people to complete the job.
                                Important points to consider:
                                 Funding: it would be very important to complete the project, you must consider this
                                from the beginning and make constant efforts to get the resource.
                                 Bureaucratic affairs: especially around the economic resources management and the
                                internal processes in your university. To have money implies fiscal subjects that are
                                necessary to remark, we recommend receiving advice about these topics in order to avoid
                                committing a misdeed or fiscal fraud without knowing. If the money goes into the account
                                of any team member, this could have implications to the person as well, such as the tax
                                payments over the received resource. Take it into account as an additional expense.
                                 Receiving reagents or the iGEM kit takes longer and it is very probable that they do
                                not arrive in time for your experimentation. Have other lines planned and act with a lot
                                of anticipation (more than three months).

                            </p>

                            <h3>13. Applying to local and international competitions</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are local and international calls that can contribute directly to the success of
                                your project, such as validations or support in monetary resources or deliverable
                                assistance. In Mexico there are state research or entrepreneurial prices developed by
                                universities, government and companies. Applying to these was essential to obtain
                                resources and prepare ourselves for the final presentation in the Grand Jamboree. All
                                the team must be attentive to these types of competitions. We recommend designating a
                                responsible person for searching and delegating the responsibilities that the
                                competition generates.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Keep attentive to the tools given by iGEM. These could go from grants, advisory
                                sessions, reagents or special programs that assist your project or members. During the
                                iGEM season, multiple opportunities are offered, and it is necessary to have a
                                responsible person to check the iGEM pages, identify the opportunities and share them
                                with the team.

                            <p>
                                When starting a project, the direction will surely not be clear. They will not know if
                                it can be patented or how, but it is necessary to protect it in case of the opportunity
                                to scale your project. Care with whom you share the idea and what you say about it.
                                Specifically, if they present it in an open forum or publish it on a platform, this can
                                interfere with the patent process and make your project public. It is important to know
                                that although it is a university project, it is still valuable and innovative. Be aware
                                that your work has value and see it as such. Trust your idea and don’t give it away.
                            </p>

                            <h3>16. Points we would have liked to consider, areas of improvement</h3>

                            <p>
                                • Mental health is a topic that is directly reflected in the project. As a team member
                                you must know how to ask for help when you are living a difficult time in your personal
                                life. Not having the mental health needed to accomplish your tasks within the team is a
                                valid reason to leave the project, and you should not be ashamed to ask for breaks or
                                quit when you need it. However, it is necessary to have commitment and responsibility
                                with the project, to leave when you need it and not at the last moment when your work
                                not done affects the deliverables of the project. Responsibility to the team also
                                involves taking care that the goals are met and not getting in the way of everyone’s
                                success together.
                                • We decided to develop this project in two years, one year for Design League and
                                another for the Grand Jamboree. Doing so allowed us to get to know our team dynamics
                                well, and our strong areas. However, maintaining consistency and motivation in an
                                independent project is difficult and by extending it, we found that we fell into dead
                                times because maintaining motivation for so long was complicated. These are long periods
                                of unrewarded effort, which helps team members' personal development, but represents a
                                daily challenge. It is an effective way to be a new team with a new project, but in the
                                future, we would seek to shorten the project development time and reduce it to a year of
                                work with breaks and planned vacations, as well as fixed work times.
                                • It is necessary to consider that there will be mistakes and always have more ways of
                                doing things. One does not have to put all the confidence that a resource will achieve
                                the goal. Inevitably time will be lost, keep it in mind and make the most of the
                                effective time.
                                • Prioritize team integration. A better project is achieved when all members feel it is
                                their own and not like working for someone else.

                            <h3>Adding new documentation to an existing part from the literature</h3>
                            <p>
                                Finding a suitable biodegradable fungicide for our genetic circuit took a lot of
                                research time, until we read about the chitinase in a few papers. Even though we found
                                the chitinase part (BBa_K3686011) on the Registry, we decided to contribute and add new
                                documentation from our research. This part of the registry is an update of the existing
                                part made by the iGEM20_SZ-SHD team designed by YingJie Lei. Information was added
                                considering the possibility of it being used as a fungicide since it has the ability to
                                destroy the cell wall of various strains of fungi, such as Fusarium spp, Sclerotium
                                rolfsii, Pythonium sp., and Rhizoctonia solani.

                                This contribution has a significant importance because it helps to expand the library of
                                registries. In this case, we didn’t found evidence on the iGEM Parts Registry of
                                chitinase being used as an antifungal. This was only superficially mentioned. Therefore,
                                we decided to add some examples to demonstrate that chitinase may be used as an
                                antifungal. Although we couldn’t perform experiments on the laboratory, we obtained
                                theoretical results, which we decided to publish, as they may be helpful for other teams
                                as a theoretical parameter. This can be validated or refuted through wet laboratory
                                experimentation. Additionally, the constant update of the parts’ information is
                                essential, as several teams (not only us) may be using or researching a certain part
                                and, through the literature, simulations, and experimentation, new information may be
                                added, which can be useful for future research and to avoid the obsolescence of
                                information.
