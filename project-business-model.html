                                <p>
                                    For the selection of our problem, we first searched for the current needs that exist
                                    in our country, more specifically in our state, by consulting the State Innovation
                                    Agenda (Agenda Estatal de Innovación, AEI) from Jalisco, a tool for state and
                                    regional economic development, to define and articulate priorities, generate
                                    intelligent solutions and leverage support for high-impact projects.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each member of the team conducted exhaustive research about a topic of their
                                    interest, seeing the impact of each of these problems, and possible solutions
                                    through synthetic biology, a vote was held among the team members, to arrive
                                    together at a topic of interest, which we saw an incredible potential as a project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a deeper identification of the problem and the design of the best possible
                                    solution, the Design Thinking methodology was used, which includes 5 steps:
                                </p>
                                <img src="images/project/design thinking.png" alt="" style="height: 500px;">
                                <p>
                                    This strategy is ideal for the general understanding of the problem based on the
                                    needs of a potential customer segment, as well as the validation of the solution
                                    that is intended to be generated through various activities implemented in the area
                                    of human practices in this project. For more information visit our Human Practices
                                    page. (LINK A HUMAN PRACTICES). We also got some professional advice in the
                                    development of the business model, in order to reach a complete and adequate
                                    business plan for the product to be generated.

                                <h4 style="margin-top: 25px; text-align: left;">MISION</h4>
                                <p>Through the advice of experts in pest control in berry crops, conversations with
                                    small and medium-sized producers, as well as export companies of these products, we
                                    seek to generate an integral strategy of biocontrol of fungal pests in berries,
                                    always considering the needs for the integrity of workers and laborers, without
                                    harming the environment. </p>


                                <h4 style="margin-top: 25px; text-align: left;">VISION</h4>
                                <p>To generate a product capable of preventive and corrective control of fungal pests
                                    affecting berry crops. </p>

                                <h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">VALUE PROPOSITION</h4>
                                <p>To conclude with our value proposition, we carried out a fundamental process of the
                                    Design Thinking method, empathizing with the affected parties to understand how the
                                    problem affects them, and clearly understand what we are solving, for which we use
                                    the Empathy Map tool, where we try to see the situation from the perspective of
                                    those affected, through a series of questions such as: What do they feel? What do
                                    they see around them? What do they hear about this issue? and What solutions do they
                                    currently implement??</p>
                                <img src="images/project/empathy map.png" alt=""
                                    style="height: 700px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 25px;">


                                <p>From this Empathy Map diagram, we could more easily perceive the need for a
                                    comprehensive, natural and organic solution to the losses that farmers are currently
                                    experiencing, without involving the health of workers, as well as the early
                                    detection of these threats in order to be able to treat them adequately.</p>
                                <img src="images/project/pains_gains.png" alt="" style="height: 500px;">

                                <p>From this we can solve losses due to pests, pest detection efforts, stimulate the
                                    immune system and plant production, reduce costs by attacking multiple pests with a
                                    genetic circuit, reduce water expenses, reduce plant losses and increase fruit
                                    quantity, from which our value proposition is born and finally structured.</p>

                                    The following process will be applied when patenting BerryVax. The general purpose
                                    of a patent is to grant an exclusive right of use over an invention. The issue of
                                    gene patents is still complicated and raises many different opinions regarding the
                                    ethical aspect. To date, it is impossible to patent a gene by itself. However, a
                                    genetically modified organism with industrial application can be patented. Depending
                                    on your country, the process varies. This section focuses on countries governed by
                                    the Budapest Treaty. This treaty was established in 1977 and states that once the
                                    patent procedure has been completed and the microorganism has been deposited in a
                                    repository, the patent is valid in all the countries that belong to the treaty.
                                    There are currently 81 members, available <a

                                </p>
                                <p>The first step is to check if your invention is patentable:</p>
                                <img src="images/project/patentable.png" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">

                                <p>From this point on, the process is specific to Mexican authorities. If you are from
                                    another country, you must check the next steps to patent a microorganism with your
                                    local authorities. The present guide can serve as a general idea of the procedure
                                    for other IGEM teams interested in patenting their products or solutions. </p>

                                <p>Next, you must check <a

                                    if your microorganism fulfills the requirements
                                    stablished by the Budapest Treaty for IDA’s (International Depositary Authorities).
                                    Once you have met those requirements, the process to follow is:</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 35px;">It is important to note that the patent of a
                                    microorganism falls into the category of
                                    industrial property, the following costs correspond to this process and category.
                                    There are additional fees that must be covered with the WIPO and the Budapest
                                    Treaty, as well as with the institution in which you deposit your microorganism.
                                    These fees depend on the country in which you are carrying out the process. The
                                    following table breaks down the fees that must be covered with the IMPI when
                                    requesting a patent.</p>

                                <p>The production process of this biofertilizer is divided into three principal
                                    operations: biomass propagation, main fermentation and product conditioning. The
                                    first one is executed by a seed reactor that is used for the biomass propagation,
                                    into this the culture media BTB-2 and the B. subtilis inoculum are administered. The
                                    exit mixture of this reactor is administered to another fermenter that acts as the
                                    main fermentation of the process, to this the KS culture media is added and after
                                    the product passes to the product conditioning, here the product is purified by
                                    microfiltration and pervaporation ending in a bottling of an 8L presentation with a
                                    1.33% B. subtilis biomass concentration. </p>

                                    payback time of the plant (6.39 years) and the production cost ($62.15 USD/bottle),
