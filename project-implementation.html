                                <h3>Brief introduction</h3>
                                <p>
                                    At iGEM ITESO, we created BerryVax as an integrated biotechnological solution for
                                    fungal pests and water scarcity in berry fields. By engineering Bacillus subtilis,
                                    it is possible to overproduce surfactin, a biosurfactant that improves fruit
                                    quality, surface wettability, and that protects the roots of the berry plants.
                                    Additionally, when BerryVax detects fusaric acid from a pathogenic fungus, it will
                                    produce an antifungal to remove the pest (Salehi et al., 2010; Coutte et al., 2015;
                                    Swain, 2008; Sandoval-Chávez et al., 2015). In order to design this solution, we did
                                    several interviews and visits to the berry fields to understand the needs of our
                                    stakeholders. During those visits, we learned that water scarcity (due to the
                                    current environmental situation) and fungal pests (because they are difficult to
                                    detect in a timely manner) were their main problems.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Business model and Viability </h3>
                                <p>
                                    We developed a business model methodology to prove if BerryVax is a financially
                                    viable option. Through this methodology, we made a business model canvas, product
                                    market analysis, benchmarking, minimum product viability, and more.
                                    The value proposition and business model are shown below:
                                </p>
                                <img src="images/project/canvas model.png" alt="" style="height: 600px;">
                                <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1. Business model canvas.</p>
                                <p>The product market analysis shows a great opportunity, the export of berries in
                                    Mexico is valued at $400 MDD, exporting 364 thousand tons around the world, and
                                    around 16% of the production is lost by fungal pests. We designed a simulation in
                                    SuperPro, which shows an analysis that demonstrates that BerryVax is a financially
                                    viable option.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Desired Implementation</h3>
                                <p>Having a functional phytovaccine with a preventive and corrective system against
                                    fungal plagues could be lifechanging for the berry crops in Mexico. BerryVax will be
                                    overproducing surfactin which will be helpful to prevent the growth of Fusarium
                                    oxysporum, a fungus that attacks the berry crops from the roots and is hard to
                                    detect on time (Nakano et al., 1988). Also, our product includes a sensing system,
                                    which can detect the presence of the fusaric acid and secrete chitinase, an enzyme
                                    that degrades chitin which is found in the cell walls of the fungi acting as an
                                    antifungal (Mihaylov et al., 2014). The third component that BerryVax has is a kill
                                    switch system; this is important because it works as a biocontainment mechanism,
                                    right before the spores begin to generate, a toxin is activated, and this will
                                    subsequently lead to the death of the bacteria (LMU, 2012). The previous description
                                    is intended for the product to be implemented outside of laboratory containment in
                                    the berry fields that are located in the western region of Mexico via the irrigation
                                    system of berry crops. </p>

                                <p>
                                    To fabricate BerryVax it is necessary to establish a series of protocols so we can
                                    make sure that the procedure inside the laboratory is efficient and effective.
                                    Detailed protocols are described in the lab section.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Stakeholders, End users, and Human Practices</h3>
                                <p>We identified three main stakeholders:</p>
                                <li>

                                    and during the harvest. It is important to note that they have the power or
                                    opportunity to do an intervention.</p>

                                <p>Next, we developed a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to transform the necessities
                                    of the farmers into requirements of our product and find the correlation between all
                                    requirements. </p>
                                <img src="images/project/QFD.PNG" alt="">


                                <p>We can observe the Quality Characteristic or functional requirements (“Hows”) on the
                                    top row and the target or limit value for that requirement on its columns and the
                                    relationship between each demand quality with symbols.</p>

                                <h3>Design and Application of the End Product </h3>
                                <p>As we have mentioned in other sections, for us, listening to our stakeholders and
                                    working together with them was the cornerstone of every aspect of our project. We
                                    developed the product prototype by talking and getting feedback from some of the
                                    farmers that we visited. BerryVax, as a product, will be sold as a liquid,
                                    containing our genetically transformed B. subtilis and the optimum medium for
                                    preservation of the bacteria. </p>

                                <p>The product will be available in presentations of 4, 8 and 16 liters with a
                                    concentration of 1.33% of biomass to satisfy the needs of the small and medium-sized
                                    berry producers. BerryVax will be ready to use like any other biofertilizer product
                                    that can be injected into the irrigation system, or manually poured, depending on
                                    the technological capabilities of every producer. </p>

                                <p>
                                    We designed and simulated the upscaling bioprocess of the production of BerryVax.
                                    The production process is divided into three principal operations: biomass
                                    propagation, main fermentation, and product recovery and packaging. Every step was
                                    well thought to obtain the highest number of viable cells. The main challenge was
                                    certainly the selection of the recovery steps. We decided to purify the biomass
                                    based on the methodology of Czinkóczky and Németh (2020) and Pereira et al. (2013),
                                    using microfiltration, slow centrifugation, and pervaporation to avoid damaging
                                    BerryVax and to eliminate substances that could reduce the preservation time of the
                                    bacteria. To know more about the simulation process, please visit our <a

                                    the environment is essential, therefore, it was sought to implement a biocontainment
                                    mechanism. A mechanism previously used by another iGEM 2012 team LMU Munich, was
                                    found, which uses a σ factor and a target promoter. We decided to implement a kill
                                    switch system to regulate the lifespan of our bacteria. After a certain period of
                                    time, the kill switch will start expressing an intracellular toxin that will cause
                                    apoptosis through the degrading of mRNA. The biocontainment system is described with

                                <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To enhance the biocontainment strategy, the use of
                                    integrative vectors was
                                    implemented with the purpose of avoiding horizontal transfer because of the use of
                                    plasmids. Once the verified genetic circuit has been inserted in the integrative
                                    vector, inside the bacteria, this vector will fuse in the DNA of the microorganism
                                    not having the chance of being a plasmid with the ability of leaving the bacterial
                                    cell and reaching another one (Couette 2021). With this biocontainment system, it is
                                    guaranteed that BerryVax will not alter the plant microbiome (Hobot, 2015). </p>

                                <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 25px;">Institutional Regulations </h4>

                                <p>In order to develop BerryVax, it is essential to comply with the institutional
                                    regulations regarding the use of ITESO’s Biotechnology Laboratories Policies. Also,
                                    while developing a project like BerryVax, it is mandatory to have a project
                                    instructor as a supervisor to revise the protocols and to oversee any experimental
                                    work. Before entering the lab, the coordinator of ITESO’s Biotechnology
                                    Laboratories, Dr. Alejandro Arana Sánchez must revise the protocols and issue an
                                    approval statement. In the case of the users of the facilities, they must understand
                                    ITESO’s Biotechnology Laboratories Policies and comply with them to ensure safety
                                    while experimenting. Additionally, the ITESO HSE board has a branch of biological
                                    hazards that can help assess and manage risks that could potentially come up while
                                    working in the laboratory.
